        <h1>Object Classes</h1>
        <p>All anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena requiring Special Containment Procedures are assigned an
            Object Class. An Object Class is a part of the standard SCP template and serves as a rough indicator for how
            difficult an object is to contain. In universe, Object Classes are for the purposes of identifying
            containment needs, research priority, budgeting, and other considerations. An SCP's Object Class is
            determined by a number of factors, but the most important factors are the difficulty and the purpose of its
            containment.This is the "Contain" part of "Secure, Contain, Protect."</p>
</div>


            <div class="headingCard">
        <h2>Primary Classes</h2>
        <p>These are the most common Object Classes used in SCP articles, and make up the bulk of the objects.</p>
    </div>
    
        <div class="card">
            <img src="./images/Safe.png" alt="Safe Class">
            <h3>Safe</h3>
            <p>Safe-class SCPs are anomalies that are easily and safely contained. This is often due to the fact that
                the
                Foundation has researched the SCP well enough that containment does not require significant resources or
                that
                the anomalies require a specific and conscious activation or trigger. Classifying an SCP as Safe,
                however, does
                not mean that handling or activating it does not pose a threat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <div class="title"><img src="./images/Euclid.png" alt="">
                <h3>Euclid</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Euclid-class SCPs are anomalies that require more resources to contain completely or where containment
                isn't
                always reliable. Usually this is because the SCP is insufficiently understood or inherently
                unpredictable.
                Euclid is the Object Class with the greatest scope, and it's usually a safe bet that an SCP will be this
                class if it doesn't easily fall into any of the other standard Object Classes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
        <div class="title"><img src="./images/Keter.png" alt="">
            <h3>Keter</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Keter-class SCPs are anomalies that are exceedingly difficult to contain consistently or reliably, with
            containment procedures often being extensive and complex. The Foundation often can't contain these SCPs well
            due to not having a solid understanding of the anomaly, or lacking the technology to properly contain or
            counter it. A Keter SCP does not mean the SCP is dangerous, just that it is simply very difficult or costly
            to contain.</p>
</div>

<div class="headingCard">
        <h2>Secondary Classes</h2>
        <p>The following object classes are less frequently used, and designate anomalies with unusual containment
            requirements.</p>
        </div>

            <div class="card">
        <div class="title"><img src="./images/Thaumiel.png" alt="">
            <h3>Thaumiel</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Thaumiel-class SCPs are anomalies that the Foundation specifically uses to contain other SCPs. Even the mere
            existence of Thaumiel-class objects is classified at the highest levels of the Foundation, and their
            locations, functions, and current status are known to few Foundation personnel outside of the O5 Council.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <div class="title"><img src="./images/Apollyon.png" alt="">
            <h3>Apollyon</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Apollyon-class SCPs are anomalies that cannot be contained, are expected to breach containment imminently, or
            some other similar scenario. Such anomalies are usually associated with world-ending threats or a K-Class
            Scenario of some kind, and require a massive effort from the Foundation to deal with.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
        <div class="title"><img src="./images/Archon.png" alt="">
            <h3>Archon</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Archon-class SCPs are anomalies that could theoretically be contained but are best left uncontained for some
            reason. Archon SCPs may be a part of consensus reality that is difficult to fully contain, or may have
            adverse effects if put into containment. These SCPs are not uncontainable - the defining feature of the
            class is that the Foundation chooses to not put the anomaly into containment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
        <div class="title"><img src="./images/Ticonderoga.png" alt="">
            <h3>Ticonderoga</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Ticonderoga-class SCPs cannot be contained, but also do not need to be contained. While these anomalies are
            similar to Archon-class SCPs in that their containment is unnecessary, Ticonderoga-class SCPs are
            distinguished by also not being containable given the Foundation's current knowledge and resources. This may
            be due to their widespread or ubiquitous occurance on Earth, despite the general public remaining unaware of
            their existence or anomalous nature, although the Ticonderoga class also includes extraterrestrial anomalies
            beyond the current reach of the Foundation.</p>
</div>
<div class="headingCard">
        <h2>Non-Standard Object Classes</h2>
        <p>Most of the following Object Classes indicate that an SCP has not yet been assigned a standard object class,
            or that it was previously assigned a Standard Object Class but no longer requires containment. There are
            also additional Object Classes that are used less frequently than the ones listed above, known as Esoteric
            or Narrative object classes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
        <div class="title"><img src="./images/Explained.png" alt="">
            <h3>Explained</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Explained SCPs are commonly articles about anomalies that are completely and fully understood, to the point
            where their effects are now explainable by mainstream science, or phenomena that have been debunked or
            falsely mistaken as an anomaly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
        <div class="title"><img src="./images/Neutralized.png" alt="">
            <h3>Neutralized</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Neutralized SCPs are former anomalies that are no longer anomalous, either through having been intentionally
            or accidentally destroyed or disabled.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
        <div class="title"><img src="./images/Deccommissioned.png" alt="">
            <h3>Deccommissioned</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Decommissioned SCPs are anomalies that have been intentionally destroyed or stripped of their anomalous
            properties by the SCP Foundation. As the Foundation usually tries to contain rather than neutralize
            anomalous objects, this object class is only used when it is not possible to fully contain an anomaly, or
            when excessive expenditure of resources is required to keep an anomaly in containment. Decommissioning may
            also be performed for ethical reasons, particularly when containment necessitates extreme suffering or is
            unable to prevent excessive loss of life. To avoid any unnecessary losses, decommissioning anomalies
            requires authorization from a higher authority, such as the O5 Council, the Ethics Committee, or the
            Decommissioning Department.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
        <div class="title"><img src="./images/Pending.png" alt="">
            <h3>Pending</h3>
        </div>
        <p>SCP articles that have not yet been assigned an object class may be labelled as Pending. This is used to
            indicate that the Foundation does not currently have enough information to assign an object class to the
            anomaly. This is a deliberate decision to emphasise that research is ongoing, and isn't the same as the
            author not knowing which object class to assign!</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
        <div class="title"><img src="./images/Uncontained.png" alt="">
            <h3>Uncontained</h3>
        </div>
        <p>SCPs that are not yet contained may be assigned an object class, often Keter, but in some articles
            Uncontained is used in place of an object class to emphasise that ongoing effort is required to establish or
            restore containment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
        <div class="title"><img src="./images/Esoteric.png" alt="">
            <h3>Esoteric Object Classes</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Additional Object classes not listed above are generally created to further the narrative in a particular SCP
            and only used once, and so are referred to as Esoteric or Narrative Object Classes. Esoteric object classes
            that are used often enough may eventually meet the requirements to be added to the list of Secondary Classes
            above. It is recommended to use one of the Primary Object Classes listed here for most SCPs, only using
            another object class if there's a good reason to justify it in the article.</p>
